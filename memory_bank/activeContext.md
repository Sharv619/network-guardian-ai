# Network Guardian AI: Active Context

## Current Status
The project is in active development with a complete MVP (Minimum Viable Product) implementation. The core threat intelligence pipeline is functional and ready for production deployment.

## What We're Working On Right Now

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Documentation Enhancement**: Creating comprehensive project documentation including memory bank files
2. **README Update**: Replacing the current basic README with the detailed project antigravity documentation
3. **Code Review**: Analyzing the existing codebase structure and patterns
4. **Production Readiness**: Ensuring all components are production-ready with proper error handling and monitoring

### Current Development Focus
- **Architecture Documentation**: Documenting the system patterns and technical context
- **Code Organization**: Understanding the flat folder structure and service-oriented architecture
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Mapping the real-time threat intelligence pipeline
- **Configuration Management**: Reviewing environment-based configuration patterns

## Key Components Being Analyzed

### Backend Services
- **AdGuard Poller**: Network traffic monitoring and data collection
- **ML Heuristics**: Shannon Entropy analysis for DGA detection
- **Anomaly Engine**: Isolation Forest for behavioral analysis
- **Gemini Analyzer**: AI-powered threat explanation with circuit breaker
- **Sheets Logger**: Google Sheets integration for audit trails

### Frontend Components
- **Dashboard**: Main threat intelligence display
- **ChatPanel**: Manual domain analysis interface
- **ThreatAnalysisPanel**: Detailed threat information display
- **Header**: Navigation and status indicators

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
- **Flat Folder Structure**: Simplified organization within each component
- **Service-Oriented Backend**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Component-Based Frontend**: React best practices
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker Compose for development and production

### Technology Stack
- **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**: Primary AI model for threat analysis
- **FastAPI**: High-performance backend framework
- **React/TypeScript**: Type-safe frontend development
- **Google Sheets API**: Data persistence and audit trails

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Documentation**: Finish updating all memory bank files
2. **README Integration**: Merge the detailed project antigravity content into the main README
3. **Code Quality Review**: Analyze existing code for improvements and best practices
4. **Production Testing**: Validate the complete system with end-to-end testing
5. **Deployment Preparation**: Ensure all components are production-ready

## Current Challenges

- **Documentation Consistency**: Ensuring all documentation is up-to-date and comprehensive
- **Code Review**: Analyzing the "vibe-coded" nature of the project for potential improvements
- **Production Readiness**: Validating all components for production deployment
