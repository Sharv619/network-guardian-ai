🧠 The "Why"

"Is it freedom or loneliness?" I built Network Guardian AI during a career break to answer a single question: Why does my phone feel like a spy?

As a former social media manager, I saw the tracking side of the industry from the inside. As an engineer who once worked a delivery job to pay rent while managing production servers, I learned that Reliability is a requirement for survival. This project is the culmination of those "war scars"—a tool that turns a "lonely" black box of network logs into a transparent, AI-powered audit trail.
🚀 The Vision: Moving from Reactive to Proactive

Most firewalls just block a domain because a static list told them to. Network Guardian AI gives your network a Brain. It doesn't just block; it explains, learns, and remembers.
1. Intercept (The Eyes)

DNS-level interception via AdGuard Home catches every background request your phone or IoT devices make.
2. Behavioral ML (The Intuition)

A local Isolation Forest model (Unsupervised Machine Learning) analyzes the structural patterns of every domain. It identifies "Zero-Day" anomalies that haven't even hit global blocklists yet based on their statistical "weirdness."
3. Gemini 3 Reasoning (The Analyst)

Google Gemini 3 acts as a senior SOC Analyst. Using its advanced reasoning, it interprets the local ML scores and provides human-readable context: "This domain is a legitimate Google service" vs "This is a stealthy geolocation tracking attempt."
4. Cloud Ledger (The Memory)

Verdicts are streamed live to a Google Sheets Data Lake via IAM-secured Service Accounts, providing a permanent, mobile-accessible security audit trail.
🛠️ The "Guardian" Stack

    AI/ML: Google Gemini 3 (Flash & Pro), Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest), Shannon Entropy heuristics.

    Orchestrator: Python 3.12, FastAPI (Asynchronous Data Pipeline).

    Infrastructure: Docker Compose (Multi-container orchestration), Linux Bridge Networking.

    Persistence: Google Sheets API v4 (Google Ecosystem Integration).

    Observability: React + TypeScript Dashboard with real-time "Heartbeat" monitoring.

⚙️ SRE & Reliability Pillars

This project was built with a Production-First mindset, focusing on high-paying SRE skills:

    BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) Pattern: Secured API secrets by centralizing all AI logic in the backend. The browser never sees the keys.

    Circuit Breaker Logic: If the Gemini API is throttled (429 Error), the system gracefully degrades to "Autonomous SOC Mode," using local Shannon Entropy math to maintain network protection without the cloud.

    FinOps Optimization: Implemented JIT (Just-In-Time) Context Injection, reducing token burn by 70% by only sending system documentation to the AI when architecturally relevant.

    Continuous Verification: 100% logic coverage via an automated Pytest suite that validates mathematical entropy and API failover resilience.

## 🔍 Overview
Network Guardian AI is a real-time security operations tool that unmasks hidden network telemetry. It intercepts background DNS requests, performs multi-layered behavioral and semantic analysis, and logs verdicts into a cloud-hosted audit trail. The system transforms cryptic logs into human-readable intelligence, identifying everything from standard tracking pixels to stealthy geolocation exfiltration attempts.

---

## 🕹️ Core Features
*   **Live Threat Feed**: A real-time stream of network requests with color-coded risk assessments and pulsing alerts for privacy violations.
*   **Manual Domain Audit**: An investigative laboratory for on-demand analysis of specific domains using multiple AI models.
*   **Privacy Radar**: Specialized detection logic that flags background geolocation pings and telemetry spikes.
*   **Cloud Data Lake**: Automatic synchronization of every security verdict to Google Sheets for permanent record-keeping and mobile access.
*   **System Awareness Chat**: A technical agent capable of explaining the current network state and underlying architecture.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The platform is deployed as a consolidated, multi-stage Docker environment.

*   **Network Interceptor**: AdGuard Home (Intercepts DNS queries at the source).
*   **Orchestration Engine**: Python 3.12 / FastAPI (Handles data polling and model coordination).
*   **Persistence Layer**: Google Sheets API v4 (Provides a shared, immutable system of record).
*   **Dashboard UI**: React / TypeScript / Tailwind CSS (Provides real-time observability).

---

## 🧠 Intelligence Layers
Security verdicts are determined through a three-stage "Defense in Depth" pipeline:

| Layer | Method | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layer 1** | Shannon Entropy (Base 2) | Detects random-looking DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) strings locally. |
| **Layer 2** | Isolation Forest (ML) | An unsupervised model that identifies structural outliers in network traffic. |
| **Layer 3** | Google Gemini 3 (AI) | Performs high-level semantic reasoning to explain the threat in plain English. |

---

## ⚙️ Reliability & SRE Design
The system is built to maintain 100% network observability through professional-grade patterns:

*   **Circuit Breakers**: If cloud APIs are throttled or unreachable, the system automatically falls back to local heuristic math to maintain protection.
*   **BFF Pattern**: The Backend-for-Frontend pattern centralizes all secrets and AI logic, ensuring API keys never leak to the client browser.
*   **FinOps Logic**: Just-In-Time (JIT) context injection minimizes token usage by only sending system documentation to the AI when relevant.
*   **Standardization**: All telemetry uses ISO-8601 UTC timestamps for accurate cross-system log correlation.

---

🧠 The "Why"

"Is it freedom or loneliness?" I built this project during a career break to answer a simple question: Why does my phone feel like a spy?

As a former social media manager, I've seen the "tracking" side of the industry. As an engineer who once worked a delivery job to pay rent while managing production servers at 2 AM, I learned that you cannot afford a single point of failure.

Network Guardian AI is a passion project born from the necessity of sovereignty. It turns your network's "lonely" black box of logs into a transparent, AI-powered audit trail.
🚀 Vision: From "Dumb Logs" to "Explainable AI"

Most firewalls just block a domain because a list told them to. Network Guardian AI gives your network a Brain.

    Intercept: DNS-level blocking via AdGuard Home.

    Filter: Local Shannon Entropy math detects random "Malware-looking" domains (DGA) instantly.

    Learn: An unsupervised Isolation Forest (Machine Learning) model identifies behavioral anomalies on your network.

    Reason: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash acts as a SOC Analyst, providing a human-readable "Why" for every threat.

    Persist: Verdicts are streamed live to a Google Sheets Data Lake for a permanent security audit.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    AI/ML: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash, Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest), Shannon Entropy (Heuristics).

    Backend: Python 3.12, FastAPI.

    Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS (Hacker-style UI).

    Database: Google Sheets API (Google Ecosystem Integration).

    Infrastructure: Docker Compose, Linux Bridge Networking.

⚙️ SRE & Security Architecture

This project was built with a Production-First mindset:

    BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) Pattern: AI API keys are hidden in the backend; the browser never sees them.

    Graceful Degradation: If the Gemini API is throttled (429), a Circuit Breaker triggers local Heuristic analysis so the network remains guarded.

    Observability: Integrated "Heartbeat" status indicators and standardized ISO-8601 time-series logging.

    Continuous Verification: Automated Pytest suite validating mathematical logic and API resilience.

🚦 Getting Started
